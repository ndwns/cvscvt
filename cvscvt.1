.Sh NAME
.Nm cvscvt
.Nd CVS/RCS to git converter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl s Ar split\-threshold Ns Op Cm s Ns | Ns Cm m Ns | Ns Cm h Ns | Ns Cm d
.Op Fl v
.Ar path ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads in a set of directory trees containing RCS files (suffix
.Cm ,v )
and converts them to a git fast\-import dump.
File revisions are grouped to change sets by author and commit log.
.Pp
Any number of paths may be given, which will be placed at the root of the resulting tree.
If a path ends in a slash, its contents will be placed at the root, otherwise this directory will be placed at the root.
It is also allowed to specify single
.Cm ,v
files.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag
.It Fl s Ar split\-threshold Ns Op Cm s Ns | Ns Cm m Ns | Ns Cm h Ns | Ns Cm d
If a potential change set contains a gap longer than this threshold between two consecutive time stamps, then the change set is split at this point.
An optional suffix for
.Cm s Ns econds ,
.Cm m Ns inutes ,
.Cm h Ns ours
or
.Cm d Ns ays
may be appended.
If no suffix is given, the threshold is interpreted as
.Cm seconds.
The default is
.Cm 300\~seconds .
.It Fl v
Show more verbose progress information on stderr.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.D1 git init repo.git
.D1 cvscvt repo.cvs/ | (cd repo.git && git fast\-import)
Import a CVS repository rooted at
.Cm repo.cvs/
into a new git repository rooted at
.Cm repo.git .
The trailing slash is important, so the files in
.Cm repo.cvs/
are placed at the root of the resulting repository.
Otherwise the resulting repository would have one directory
.Cm repo.cvs
at its root.
